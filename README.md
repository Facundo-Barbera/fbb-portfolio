# Personal Portfolio

Hello! I'm Facundo (BiXKu) Bautista Barbera, and this is my personal portfolio mono-repo.
This project currently is under development, but the idea is to place portfolio projects here.

Additionally, given the current AI surge, I'm trying to make this project as organically as possible.
Yes, some of the code will be AI generated with tools like copilot, but the project itself (meaning the combination of the years of projects, activities, etc.) is going to be created manually.

## Current goal

This section is for me.

The current idea is to use Linux CLI based machines to program.
My friends are telling me to just use a normal Linux setup.
I don't care, I want to do this myself, however I want to.

### What is my current working environment

For school projects I'm using JetBrains IDEs, GitHub, and many other convencional tools.
Specifically for *this* project I created a VM with Arch, and manually configured it.
It was a long and painful process (took me like 2 days) but I have found a good configuration that I like.
Originally, I planned to use the CLI only Arch version, which was working fine, but since I'm in a VM and I do want to use a browser, I wanted to have a tool to copy an paste.
I ended up using a custom X11 with XTerm configuration.
This is still very similar to what I had, but it has some extra features and honestly it just looks nice.
Configuring Arch was challenging, coming from a spot where my only interactions with Linux where through Docker.

### Tools

#### NVIM

I'm using NVIM!
This is not the first time I tried it, but I never could quite understand how to use it.
I *think* I'm getting the hang of it, but it has a huge learning curve.
It has been fun to learn, but slow.
Honestly, I'm using it primarily because I thought nano was a little too... little.
It's a good tool (and I know people will say "Um... Actually there is this tool...", idc), but I'm so use to IDEs.
A close friend of mine mentioned that they switched to NVIM some time ago, when I was building my Arch setup it helped me get through some of the configs.

#### Git

Obvious tool when using repositories, and in general, coding, I guess.
But I never really *used* git, I've always relied on visual tools to do stuff for me.
I want to dive into actually using it in the command line and working projects with lots of files in jus the terminal.


## Notes

For now, that's it, I will update this README regularly until I can call this a professional level portfolio project.
I hope I learn a lot from this and that whoever reads this can learn alongside me.
